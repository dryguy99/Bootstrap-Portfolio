                  <p>A Web Developer, Swim Coach, Aquatics Expert and Outdoorsman who likes to travel are just some of the ways to describe Timothy Dry.  Tim’s love of computers came at a young age with his first pc the Atari 800.  With the Atari he taught himself BASIC and then Pascal and used them to write games to play.  Tim joined message boards, found email, and was one of the first 10,000 to join AOL for its access to information, music and knowledge.  As the web became a big part of everyone’s lives, Tim taught himself some html and built his first website for his swimmers.  The site, still in use today, was designed to  give the swimmers he coached information they needed for their team.  Tim likes the hardware as much as the software preferring to buy components and build his pc’s.  He enjoys learning how the latest technologies worked and integrating them into his current pc.  He has never bought a whole pc at once preferring to use old parts with new to keep the technology up to date for his family. Tim stays up to date with technology by reading tech blogs, articles, websites and continuing to work closely with technology.</p>
        
                  <p> Tim is the oldest of 5 siblings and was sent for swim lessons when his siblings started to outnumber his parents.  His parents liked to sail; something Tim and his father still do today. Being safe on the water was important and by age 8 Tim swam well.  After learning to swim he joined the swim team, became a Water Safety Instructor, lifeguard, swim coach and an Aquatic Director.  Tim’s love of physics and hydrodynamics helped him understand how swimming worked.  His ability to take that knowledge and explain it so others understand made him a good instructor and coach.</p>

                  <p>Tim joined scouts as soon as he was able.  Enjoying the outdoors, camping and learning helped Tim to reach the rank of Eagle Scout.  With the Scouts, his friends and his family, Tim has camped in 47 of the 50 US states, gone white water rafting, hiked the Grand Canyon, climbed on glaciers, rocked climbed mountains, canoed and kayaked and sailed on the ocean.  He has visited Canada, Ireland, Scotland, England, France, Switzerland and Italy.  But no matter how far he travels, Tim always comes back to NJ.</p>
